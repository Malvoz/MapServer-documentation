MS RFC 124: Improving SLD Support in MapServer
==============================================

:Date: 2019-04-10
:Author: Jérome Boué

:Status: Draft
:Version: TBD


1. Motivation
=============

The current implementation of SLD/SE in MapServer has many drawbacks. This RFC
proposes to address some of them towards a better support. So far, the
following issues have been identified:

1. **Arithmetic expressions**: MapServer implementation of SLD doesn't handle
   <Add>, <Sub>, <Mul>, <Div> operations or <Literal> or <PropertyName>
   elements in <SvgParameter> or in other elements expected to hold arithmetic
   expressions.

2. **WMS GetStyles request**: A WMS GetStyles request returns a SLD file based
   only on Mapfile configuration even if a SLD or SLD_BODY parameter is
   present in the request.

3. **Style layering**: When several styling rules apply to a feature, only the
   first one is taken into account, instead of appliyng them all by following
   the *painters model* as described in Symbology Encoding specification.

4. **Mark or ExternalGraphic in LineSymbolizer**: MapServer implementation of
   SLD doesn’t handle <Mark> or <ExternalGraphic> elements in a
   <LineSymbolizer> element.

5. **LineSymbolizer and PolygonSymbolizer in Rule**: MapServer implementation
   of SLD doesn’t handle both <LineSymbolizer> and <PolygonSymbolizer> in the
   same <Rule> element (which is more expressive than both <Fill> and <Stroke>
   in the same <PolygonSymbolizer>).

6. **UserLayer**: MapServer implementation of SLD doesn’t handle <UserLayer>
   element.

The next sections of this RFC develop for each issue the proposed solution and
implementation details.


2. Arithmetic expressions

========================================

Hi,

I’m starting to work on improving SLD support in MapServer. So far,
we’ve identified seven issues that should be fixed for the benefit of our
internal projects and hopefully of the whole community of MapServer
users. These issues are:

Currently I’m working on issues #7 and #3. I plan to open issues and write RFC.
Any comments, discussions or advices from former developers of SLD in MapServer, or from other
MapServer experts, are warmly welcome.

Moreover, I am studying the possibility of attending the upcoming OSGeo
Community Sprint 2019 to be held in Minneapolis in May.

Regards,
Jérome.
